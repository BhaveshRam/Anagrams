# Anagrams

Python or Python3 is required to run the program
Aditionally we require a library named Collections

The above program is used to divide the same word anagrams into a list and all these lists are then appended into a larger list.

Using a method from Collections library we check the frequency of the letters and return true if they match.
If they are matching then they are anagrams of the same word.
